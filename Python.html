<p>Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language.
   Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability, notably using significant whitespace. It provides constructs that enable clear programming on both small and large scales.
   Van Rossum led the language community until stepping down as leader in July 2018.</p>
